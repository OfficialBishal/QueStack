1. Describe Von Neumann Machine. Differentiate Hardwired control unit and Micro

programmed control unit. [4+4]
2. Draw the internal architecture of 8086 microprocessor and explain it. [8]
3. How is looping is implement in 8085 programs? Explain how nested looping can be done.

Elaborate with suitable example. [8]
4. Write a program for 8085 to count the numbers for which upper nibble is higher than the

lower nibble; and store the count at the end of table having 50 bytes data from C050H. [8]
5. Explain the process of assembling, linking and executing of assembly language program.

Differentiate one-pass and two pass assembler. [5+3]

6. Write and assembly language program for 8086 to read a number (1 to 9 only) from user
and calculate the factorial of it and display in decimal format. [8]

7. What is instruction cycle and machine cycle? Explain the timing diagram instruction LXI
B, AOSOH with necessary diagram. [2+6]

8. Differentiate synchronous bus and asynchronous bus. Design an address decoding circuit
to interface 4 KB ROM and 2KB RAM. The starting address is 4000 H. Use suitable

decoder. [2+6]
